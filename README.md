# Collision Treatment - MATLAB Project

## üìú Description
The **Collision Treatment** project simulates the interaction between two circles in a 2D space, focusing on their collision dynamics. It calculates the initial and final velocities and momentum of the circles based on their masses and initial speeds. The simulation visually represents the movement of the circles, demonstrating their interactions as they collide and rebound within a defined space.

## ‚ö° Key Features
- **Collision Detection**: Identifies when the two circles collide based on their positions and radii.
- **Momentum Calculation**: Computes the velocities of the circles before and after the collision, adhering to the principles of conservation of momentum.
- **Real-time Visualization**: Displays the movement of the circles on a 2D plot, providing a clear visual representation of their interaction over time.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies
- **Programming Language**: MATLAB
- **Mathematics**: Physics-based calculations for momentum and velocity
- **Visualization**: MATLAB's built-in plotting functions for graphical representation
